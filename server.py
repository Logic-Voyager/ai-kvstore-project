'''
explaination: 
The server code is designed to manage a key-value store, handle multiple clients 
concurrently using gevent, and support various commands (GET, SET, DELETE, etc.).

gevent library: Provides tools for asynchronous networking and concurrency. Here, it enables 
the server to handle multiple clients at once.

Pool: Manages a pool of greenlets (lightweight threads) to limit the number of concurrent connections.

ProtocolHandler class: Manages the in-memory key-value store and processes commands. Each instance 
has a store attribute, which is a dictionary that acts as the key-value storage.

handle_request method: Processes client commands. It splits the incoming request into parts, interprets 
the command, and performs the appropriate action on the store.

1. SET key value: Adds or updates the key-value pair in the dictionary and returns "OK". 
2. GET key: Retrieves the value for a specified key. If the key doesn't exist, it returns "NULL".
3. DELETE key: Removes the specified key from the store. If the key is deleted, it returns "OK", otherwise "NOT FOUND".
4. FLUSH: Clears the entire store, returning "OK".
5. MGET key1 key2 ...: Retrieves values for multiple keys and returns them as a space-separated string. If a key doesnâ€™t exist, 
it returns "NULL" for that key.
6. MSET key1 value1 key2 value2 ...: Sets multiple key-value pairs. If the input is incorrectly formatted, it returns "ERROR". 
Otherwise, it adds all pairs and returns "OK".

handle_client function: Receives requests from a client, processes them with ProtocolHandler, and sends back responses. 
The loop continues until the client disconnects.

start_server function: Sets up the server to listen on the specified IP and port. The SO_REUSEADDR option allows 
immediate reuse of the port after the server stops.

Pool and ProtocolHandler: ProtocolHandler is instantiated to manage the store, while Pool limits the number of 
concurrent clients (10 in this case).

pool.spawn: Starts a new greenlet for each client connection, allowing concurrent handling without blocking.
__main__ block: Starts the server when the script is run.


RUN COMMAND: To run this command, type python server.py in terminal.
